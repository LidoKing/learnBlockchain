WALLETS:
- Wallet stores pub and priv keys but not account balance
- Pub key is derived from priv key using ECDSA (X, Y coordinates)
- Address
  1. Hashing (sha256 + ripemd160)
  2. Concatenate checksum, pubKeyHash and version to get full hash
  3. Encode full hash (base58)
- Balance of an account is just the total sum of unspent outputs locked by the address

TRANSACTIONS:
- A tx contains inputs and outputs
- Sum of outputs must equal that of inputs
- Inputs must point to outputs from previous txs
- Creation process
  1. Get unspent outputs (i.e. balance) of sender
  2. Create inputs, leaving only 'signature' field empty
  3. Create outputs and lock them with receiver addresses (extra amounts will be sent back to sender so that output sum always equals to input sum)
    a) Lock = convert receiver address to pubKeyHash
  4. Hash tx to get ID of tx
  5. Sign tx and fill in 'signature' field of inputs respectively
    a) Create a copy of tx
    b) Replace PubKey field of inputs to actual PubKeyHash of corresponding outputs
    c) Hash the copy to get ID for signing
    d) Concatenate first and second part of signature to complete it
